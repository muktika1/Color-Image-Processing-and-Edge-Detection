# Color-Image-Processing-and-Edge-Detection
There is an image of a ball which has been obtained by a camera on a robot. The goal is to help the robot identify the ball in its surroundings. 
##Step 1
First step is to process the image with the help of a function that will convert rgb to hsi.
##Step 2
Then we compare the custom made function to the built in function of matlab and see the results and differences.
##Step 3
Next we find the edges of the image using several edge detection methods.
##Step 4
Final step is to find a threshold for the ball and then to find the centroid of the ball. We indicate the location with an x mark on the center of the ball.
